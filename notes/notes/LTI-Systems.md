Need to understand what [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) is.
Need to understand [linearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_system#Definition)

Is a special case of a [Transfer Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function).
A transfer function takes a function x(t) as input and maps it onto  a function y(t) by applying some kind of transformation. The important thing seems to be that both input and output are functions.
